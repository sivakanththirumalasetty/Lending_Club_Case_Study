# Lending Club Case Study

## Goals of data analysis:  

Objective:
Objective is to comprehend the driving factors (or driver variables) that are responsible for loan default ie variables that are strong signs of default. This knowledge can serve as a basis for the portfolio and risk assessment.

Assignment Summary :
You are employed by Lending Club, a consumer finance company that focuses on giving urban consumers different kinds of loans. This company, which specializes in personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures, is the biggest online lender. Through a speedy web interface, borrowers can easily obtain loans with lower interest rates. Based on the applicant's profile, the company must determine whether to approve the loan when it receives the application. When an individual applies for a loan, the company has two options:

Loan accepted: Three scenarios arise if the business approves the loan, as outlined below:

Completely paid: The loan (principal and interest) has been paid in full by the applicant.

Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)

Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.

Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan

Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)
